# 🛰️ Gaulix Toulouse - Community MQTT Gateways

This project is part of the **Gaulix** initiative — a nationwide open-source mesh network in France based on **LoRa** and **Meshtastic**.

We’ve started deploying **MQTT gateways** in the **Toulouse area** to help extend the Gaulix mesh and contribute to a resilient, community-driven radio network.

---

## ⚙️ What's Installed in Toulouse

- ✅ LoRa Meshtastic nodes running on TTGO/Heltec boards  
- ✅ MQTT gateways connected to the official Gaulix MQTT broker  
- ✅ Initial coverage in Toulouse city center (more coming soon!)

---

## 🔧 How to Join

1. Flash a compatible board with [Meshtastic firmware](https://flasher.meshtastic.org)
2. Set the Gaulix LoRa channel (LM868 MHz, encrypted)
3. Use this project to deploy an MQTT gateway (Docker or native)
4. Add your node to the Gaulix map: [map.gaulix.fr](https://map.gaulix.fr)

## 💡 Next Steps

- Add sensor data (air quality, weather, noise)
- Build a local MQTT dashboard
- Expand node coverage in the Toulouse region

## 🤝 Get Involved

Anyone in Toulouse can join — even with basic hardware or curiosity.  
We’re building something simple, legal, and useful.
